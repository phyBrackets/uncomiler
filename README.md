# uncompiler
-Unknown Compiler , prolly written in C++. Designing it for the lerarning purpose , don't know if i can add some weird stuffs in future inside this.
-start with a language that has only five lexical elements:
-for now the four basic maths operators:`+`,`-`,`*`,`/`
-decimal whole numbers which have `1` or more digits `0 .. 9`
